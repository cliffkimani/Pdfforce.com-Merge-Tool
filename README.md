### Merge PDF – Combine Multiple PDFs into One Document

The Merge PDF tool on PDFForce is designed to solve one of the most common document problems: receiving or working with PDFs that exist as multiple separate files. Whether you are handling contracts with multiple attachments, reports split into chapters, invoices from different sources, or scanned documents saved individually, merging PDFs into a single file is often essential.

PDFForce’s Merge PDF tool allows you to upload multiple PDF files directly in your browser and combine them into one unified document. You can easily reorder files before merging, ensuring the final PDF follows the correct structure and page flow. This eliminates the need to manually recreate documents or rely on bulky desktop software.

Unlike many online tools, PDFForce focuses on reliability and simplicity. The merge process preserves original layout, formatting, and quality, ensuring the final document looks exactly as intended. There are no unnecessary watermarks added, and no software installation is required, making it ideal for quick, everyday use.

The Merge PDF tool is commonly used alongside other PDFForce tools such as 
[Split PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/split) when extracting specific sections, 
[Compress PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/compress) to reduce file size after merging, and 
[Protect PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/protect) to secure the final document before sharing.

For scanned documents or image-based files, users often combine merging with 
[OCR PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/ocr) to make the merged file searchable and selectable. This creates a complete workflow where documents are consolidated, optimized, and prepared for real-world use.

Merge PDF on PDFForce is built for students, freelancers, professionals, and teams who need fast, predictable results without friction. Whether you’re submitting documents, archiving records, or preparing files for clients, the tool helps you turn scattered PDFs into a single, clean document you can confidently share or store.
